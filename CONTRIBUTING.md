# Contributing Guidelines

## Intended Release Cycle

To create releases in this repository, we use [release-please](https://github.com/googleapis/release-please).

The [release-please-action](https://github.com/google-github-actions/release-please-action) automatically detect changes
from the last release and creates a Release Pull Request. This PR updates the CHANGELOG and the version information
based on [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

To release a new version, merge the Release Pull Request. The release-please-action detects the merge commit and
triggers further release steps.
